# Contributing to the Intervalometerator

Thanks for your interest in our labour of love.

This is our first "proper" GitHub project, so we're making this up as we go. As you can probably tell.

The project started as a means to shoot a time-lapse in a remote location in New Zealand, and we're aware there's a lot of opportunity to evolve it (feature-wise) as well as improve the existing functionality. See the list of [open Enhancements](/labels/enhancement) for the current wish-list of improvements, and feel free to add your own.


For "obvious" fixups and minor improvements, please fork, code & raise a pull request.

If you want to make more significant changes, please raise an issue here and outline the proposal, or <a href="https://twitter.com/greiginsydney" target="_blank">ping greig via Twitter</a> to initiate contact.
